For loops only work on iterables.
Iterables are basically a group of elements.

for x in ('Atul'):
    print(x)

x = input("Enter a word: ")
count=0
for a in x:
    if x=='a':
        count+=1
print('Count= ',count)

while loop iterates a block of code till a specified condition is true.

for loop iterates a block of code number of times same as the number of elements in the iterables.
If iterates for the number of iterables from the first element to the last element.
