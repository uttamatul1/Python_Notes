Python is a general purpose programming language.

Feartures of python:-
1) Highly extensive. Capabilities can be improved by importing libraries.
2) Simple syntax.
3) Multi paradigm programming language. Ex- Structure, OOP.
4) Emphasis on code readibility.
5) Dynamic typing. At run time the expression type is automatically decided.
6) Automatic memory management
7) Dynamic binding. When we call a function, which function will run will be decided on runtime.
8) Precise coding.
9) For time critical operations, python can use modules written in C language.
10) Indentation base block of code
11) Large library
12) Platform independent

Basic steps to make software in C/C++ :-
Preprocessor edits the .c filr and solved the #include statements etc.
Compiler is used to change source code to machine code(Binary).
Linker takes the object file from compiler and mixes with the library file and makes the last executable file.

Pyhton's compiler converts it in machine code but it can not run directly in any platform. 
So Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is user to run this (Byte code)machine code. There are different PVM for different platforms.
Hence python is known as platform independent language.
PVM has interpretor(Just in time compiler).
