break keyword is used to terminate the execution of loop.
It is always outside the loop.

a = 1
while a <=3:
    i = int(input('Enter an number: '))
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        print('Even')
    else:
        print('Odd')
        break
    a+=1

else block executes when while loop terminates normally.
else block won't be executed when loop terminated due to break statement.

pass keyword is used to create empty blocks.
a = 1
while a <=3:
    i = int(input('Enter an number: '))
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        print('Even')
    else:
        pass
    a+=1
