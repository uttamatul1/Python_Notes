Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset

Python is a dynamic type language which means that not only the value of a variable may change during
program execution but the type as well.
Ii is also comparatively slow as compared to static type language.
