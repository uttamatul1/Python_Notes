Different data types (class) in python:-
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

Python is a dynamic type language which means that not only the value of a variable may change during
program execution but the type as well.
It is also comparatively slow as compared to static type language.

Memory Management:- If x = 5
Namespace/Stack - x | Reference variable where the ID of object is stored
Private heap space - 5 | Dynamic object | Made at runtime
Garbage block - If there is no pointer pointing on a object in private heap space. Then that object is garbage block.
Garbage collection - Python automatically calls this program. If checked that if there are any garbage 
blocks in private heap space and releases them.
Memory leak- If there is no pointer pointing on a object in private heap space. Happens in C/C++
Using del keyword we do not release the objects. We delete Stack.

Object is an instance of a class.
In python everything is an object:-
1) Instance object - x=5
2) Function object - print
3) Class object - int
