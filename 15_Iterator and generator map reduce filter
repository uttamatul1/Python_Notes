An iterator can be seen as a pointer to a container (set, dict etc).
The iterator is an abstraction which enables the programmer to access all the elements of a container
without any deeper knowledge of the data structure of this container object.
Iterator is implicitly available for loop.

Container is an which contains many other objects.

next method returns the element pointed by specified iterator object.
next method advances iterator object so that it can point to next element of the container object.

When next method is called for an iterator object which surpasses the last object of the container
object, it produces StopIteration exception.
