Number = int(input('Enter your number: '))
if Number > 0:

match is a soft keyword, hence can be used as variable.
For those of you who have some background in other languages like Java or C, match case may look like a switch statement.
Switch statements are functionally similar to if-else statements, but they require less code when defining the cases.
The match case statement in Python is more powerful and allows for more complicated pattern matching.

>>> command = 'Hello, World!'
>>> match command:
...     case 'Hello, World!':
...         print('Hello to you too!')
...     case 'Goodbye, World!':
...         print('See you later')
...     case other:
...         print('No match found')
